#Recursive search of JSON object
Sometimes we come across a requirement to search for a Json object that has a particular key equalling a particular value.  A simple example is a search thru a composite parts list in json, for a part with a name 'big-nut'. The composite Json is:

{"machine":{"name": "complex",
"price": 1000000,
"composite": ({"name": "small nut", "price": 1}}}
