### Three Bucket vs One Bucket approach to Money Management
#### Overview

Money management gets more and more important now, as money itself can generate a substantial income as you advance through the years. When in retirement money management is often the only income.  
The three bucket approach is to ensure a sense of stability considering stress and inclding the primary purpose - to have a good life. 
The one bucket approach is to invest in the highest return in the stock market, and claims that this will ensure better income both immediately and over time. The simulations will show that this aligns with the primary purpose - to have a good life and stress is not necessary.

#### Project:  
Show the performance over 10 years of a three bucket approach vs the one bucket approach.

#### Three bucket approach:
*
Bucket 1: Six months’ to two years’ worth of living expenses—not covered by Social Security—are housed in cash instruments.  
•
Bucket 2: Another 8-10 years’ worth of living expenses are housed in bonds.  
•
Bucket 3: The remainder of the portfolio is invested in stocks and a high-risk bond fund.  
Income and rebalancing proceeds from Buckets 2 and 3 are used to replenish Bucket 1 as it becomes depleted.
These investment portfolio examples include aggressive, moderate, and conservative portfolio options to align with a retiree’s level of risk tolerance. The portfolios are designed to be held in either tax-sheltered or taxable accounts. A retiree can build the right portfolio for their needs by customizing their allocations based on their own expected portfolio withdrawals.  

#### One bucket approach:

Put everything in stocks and a high-risk bond fund. This approach assumes that there are atleast 8-10 years worth of living expenses to start with.

Develop and implement a web based/app based application that Simulates both approaches with reasonable assumptions based on currently available data on the internet. For Example:
1. Average stock market return: 10% varies(The year/year performance can be from the internet)
2. Average return on bonds: 4.5%
3. Average return on Savings Acct: 0.4 to 4
