# Sleep Apnea - spo2 measurement

## Updates: Further Recordings with Tens
### Update summary: 
Wore tens and went to sleep and got up 6 hrs later. Had forgotten to turn on the SpO2 recording. Started it and went to sleep again and got this 30-40 min recording. Again Tens seemed to have worked.  Here is a picture of my Tens from Temu:

The 'X' indicates the dome-shaped steel electrodes. These are beneath a white paper tape, I put. This paper tape comes between the throat and the electrodes to make the prickly tens shocks tolerable for sleep. I have a suspicion that just the feeling of the instrument may prevent the throat muscles from relaxing(?).  
Below the latest Tens recording of sleep.

## Updates: Recordings with Tens
### Tens Overview:
A tens machine was purchased from Temu. This is a unit that 'jerks' the throat muscles with low level current pulses via a small device placed around the throat and secured there using earbands. The electrodes are 'metal balls' that touch either side of the throat. The concept involved is to keep the airways open by preventing the 'relaxation' of throat muscles, which occurs in sleep apnea. Many journal articles point to the effectiveness of Tens in treating sleep apnea.  
An issue soon became apparent. Human hair is conductive specially when moist. The electrical pulses where causing 'pin-prick-sensitivity' probably at the hair follicle. To prevent that a dry tissue was placed over the electrodes.

### Results: 
In an one-hour sleep session, the tens seemed to work. The chart is shown below and notice the steady SpO2 level in the mid-90's.

### Conclusion:
More results are needed with Tens. The one hour sleep session is not enough, but shows good promise.

## Main Article
What if you don't breathe? Very obviously, the body will lack oxygen, stop providing energy required or organs to operate (including the brain..) and that is the end! Sure, however somewhere in the body/brain, this is monitored, and panic sets in, and breathings jerks with a gasp, the heart rate goes up and SpO2, yes SpO2 - the oxygen in your blood surges up, and soon all is back to normal!

This is what happens in 'Sleep Apnea'.  So at just $59, this SpO2 device that monitors your SpO2 for 40+hours continuously is a deal!

Here is my SpO2 (along with the heart-rate) on two recordings:

and

The green area represents the acceptable ranges for the SpO2 (between 100 and 88) and the Heart Rate (40-80 during sleep).  


#Analysis:
Before getting concerned about the points outsize the green region, look at the label 'every 1.00 seconds' along the x-axis.  
<b>Heart Rate:</b>The heart rate is beats/minute, and how is that to vary every second? Mathematically this is a problem. So dismiss that variation in heart rate!  
<b>SpO2 levels:</b>The SpO2 relates to amount of oxygen in the blood, and how is that to vary every second? The Oxygen levels will not drop or rise this much within a second! Mathematically this is a problem. So dismiss that variation in SpO2!  
So the $59 gone down the drain?   

#Conclusion:

1. We should only look at the 'trend' line - i.e. some sort the average value among the many points. So with that in mind the charts look good, all green!  
2. Note the variance between samples that seems to occur about 0.8 hours after sleep start. Does this mean that around this time, the throat is relaxed and breathing irregularity occurs. However the body is quick to respond, and the SpO2 remains good.  Some discerning eyes may also observe the heart rate going up (i.e. one - two extra beats inversely with the SpO2 with a slight lag!).This fine-tuned adjustment of the body is remarkable!

So the $59 is well worth! If you pay more that $59, breathing patterns can be monitored as well, and all results should co-ordinate even better!
