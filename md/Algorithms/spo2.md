# Sleep Apnea - spo2 measurement
        
What if you don't breathe? Very obviously, the body will lack oxygen, stop providing energy required or organs to operate (including the brain..) and that is the end! Sure, however somewhere in the body/brain, this is monitored, and panic sets in, and breathings jerks with a gasp, the heart rate goes up and SpO2, yes SpO2 - the oxygen in your blood surges up, and soon all is back to normal!

This is what happens in 'Sleep Apnea'.  So at just $59, this SpO2 device that monitors your SpO2 for 40+hours continuously is a deal!

Here is my SpO2 (along with the heart-rate) on two recordings:

and

The green area represents the acceptable ranges for the SpO2 (between 100 and 88) and the Heart Rate (40-80 during sleep).  


#Analysis:
Before getting concerned about the points outsize the green region, look at the label 'every 1.00 seconds' along the x-axis.  
<b>Heart Rate:</b>The heart rate is beats/minute, and how is that to vary every second? Mathematically this is a problem. So dismiss that variation in heart rate!  
<b>SpO2 levels:</b>The SpO2 relates to amount of oxygen in the blood, and how is that to vary every second? The Oxygen levels will not drop or rise this much within a second! Mathematically this is a problem. So dismiss that variation in SpO2!  
So the $59 gone down the drain?   

#Conclusion:

1. We should only look at the 'trend' line - i.e. some sort the average value among the many points. So with that in mind the charts look good, all green!  
2. Note the variance between samples that seems to occur about 0.8 hours after sleep start. Does this mean that around this time, the throat is relaxed and breathing irregularity occurs. However the body is quick to respond, and the SpO2 remains good.  Some discerning eyes may also observe the heart rate going up (i.e. one - two extra beats inversely with the SpO2 with a slight lag!).This fine-tuned adjustment of the body is remarkable!

So the $59 is well worth! If you pay more that $59, breathing patterns can be monitored as well, and all results should co-ordinate even better!
