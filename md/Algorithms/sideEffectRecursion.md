# Side Effect Recursion
## Overview: 
Recursion is a distinct topic in programming. It requires thinking in a different way, and that is difficult for many including this Author. So after much trial and error, I came up with the idea of 'side effect recursion', which is easier to understand and apply. Recursion can be conceptually thought of a iterative refinement of a solution until solved.  In the 'side effect recursion', this iterative solution is passed as a paramenter to the recursive function allowing the function to refine the solution. When the function determines that the solution is reached, it just returns True. This overview will be continued later after the following trivial eternal example of recursion - the factorial.
