# Sleep Tracker App
## About
Google Play store: 'Sleep Tracker = Sleep Recorder: Leap Fitness Group'
Info: Sleep cycle tracker, snore recorder, smart alarm & relaxing sounds to aid sleep


## Experience:
Great! This is very easy to use- download, open, click 'start sleeping' and place phone on mattress next to you and when you wake up, click some more buttons and get a whole lot of info on your sleep. It records all events throughout your sleep, categorizes them into sleep cycles, sounds etc. and the reports are graphic, numbers and intuitive.

You can scroll through your recordings, and speculate on what led to good sleep and pushes you to take action.

## Screenshots

The screen shots are so intuitive, that I point out only things you may not notice at first glance.

Notes: Besides actually hearing your snoring noises, other noises you make also appear here. Also other noises in the environment can tell you what sounds are happening while you sleep!
