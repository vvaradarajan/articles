# Make Forms on Web
## Intro
You are instructor, teacher, seller, business owner..whatever your need may be to collect information from your clients all over the Web.. you need to make forms on the internet. Your clients can fill it in from anywhere, and you have the data that you can work with.  
Now you can do this all 'yourself' with a easy to use english like YAML script. Just specify the pieces of data to collect, and voila, your form appears on the Web, ready for your clients.

## Overview
The form is specified in Yaml, which is a structured yet user-friendly and intuitive english document. This document is converted into a HTML form and displayed on the Web, ready for use. 

## Details
Here are some forms for collecting data for a Yoga class:  
<a href="/articles/?path=Algorithms,formGen.md&detail=childEnrollment">Enrollment form - Child</a>
<a href="/articles/?path=Algorithms,formGen.md&detail=yogaIntake">Vayu form - Therapy</a>




## Experience:
Great! This is very easy to use- download, open, click 'start sleeping' and place phone on mattress next to you and when you wake up, click some more buttons and get a whole lot of info on your sleep. It records all events throughout your sleep, categorizes them into sleep cycles, sounds etc. and the reports are graphic, numbers and intuitive.

You can scroll through your recordings, and speculate on what led to good sleep and pushes you to take action.

## Screenshots

The screen shots are so intuitive, that I point out only things you may not notice at first glance.

Notes: Besides actually hearing your snoring noises, other noises you make also appear here. Also other noises in the environment can tell you what sounds are happening while you sleep!
