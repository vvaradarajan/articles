# YouTube AI and Bull of an Idea

## The Issue:
The world has always been in an uproar about Bullfighting. The mighty and majestic bull being cheated, tortured and finaly killed by a fancy dresseed, fickle hearted, puny 'matador' who dare not face the bull in a bare handed one on one, but hides behind screens and a lot of humans as decoys, and when the bull runs past, throws sharp pointed spears into bull.  Come-on folks.. eshew cowardice.. Let us have a fair fight!

## The Final solution
Here is a fair fight.. A large pit containing 10 bulls running around, and the daring human is dropped in. The unfettered bulls have at this human for five minutes during which the human dodges and weaves. At the end of this period, a semi-greased pole is lowered and the human (if still surviving) climbs the pole, and escapes the pit! A very humane game for the bulls! Revenge at last!

## The intermeadiate steps

Wow! what a final solution! Oops.. nobody can try this legally yet, so YouTube and AI to the rescue. We need to create this entire new Bullfight as a Youtube Video. An AI model with bull behaviour, a herd of bulls in a pit. All the bulls scamper around in the Pit. Then the human is lowered into the pit and the action starts!

YouTube making is very hard, and so using AI to do this => a model that creates a YouTube movie, given the description above in this article. What a bull of an idea!
