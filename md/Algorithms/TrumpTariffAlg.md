# I know Economics

## Concepts  
Trade deficits ($imports - $exports) are losses. To eliminate this loss, the tariff equal to this must be levied and collected by the US Govt. That's it!

Since this formula is too simple, let us give a discount of 50% on the tariffs.

## Implementation:
Vietnam as an example: Exports $113 b, Imports 13b => loss(deficit) = 100b. = tariff total. Tariff rate = (total tariff/exports) = 100/113 = 88.5% => (50% discount) => 44.25%
