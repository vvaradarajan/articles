# Late vs Early Withdrawal from Tax perspective

## Overview
What is the Question? : 
Withdrawals from IRA are treated as ordinary income, and ordinary income tax rates are higher at the higher slab rates (some 37%). The capital gains tax rate is less (at most 20%). Therefore if we withdraw, the income earned after withdrawal is taxed at the capital gain tax rate.  
The question is: Is withdrawing early is good?

## Problem Discussion
In Early withdrawal, the tax has to be paid right away. After that any income earned (i.e. the withdrawal amount is invested in stocks earning capital gains income) 
In Late withdrawal, the ordinary income tax has to be paid at the withdrawal time.  
The after tax income of these two should be compared for some period of time (10 years or so) to answer to the question.  

## One simulation
The simulation below shows that Late withdrawal is better:

## Result Discussion

Intuitively the results are dependent on otr and ctr. The higher the otr, the more the tax paid early, leaving less for investment. This favors late withdrawal. From a different perspective, a lower ctr favors early withdrawal.  
In addition there the timing of withdrawal allows another variable - the value of otr. In low income years otr will be smaller, and withdrawing when the otr is low is a strategy. A different formula results. (I will extend this article in due time..!)

How to type equations? LaTex, the academic standard is not easy. An easier one is LyX which has a workable visual interface, and if needed you can copy the equation as a pdf/image (which is used here) or as LaTex. So since math is getting prominence in retirement ("In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except math and taxes!") it will be a good idea to discuss LyX
