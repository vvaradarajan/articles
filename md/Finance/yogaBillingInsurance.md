# Yoga session billing

## Overview
Pay the invoice to the therapist directly.  
Login to your Insurance site to upload documents and claim insurance reimbursement for the amount you paid. Insurance will process your claim, adjust it for deductibles, co-pay etc. and either directly deposit the reimbursement amount to your bank, or send you a check.

## Summary from internet: 
Yes, insurance can cover yoga therapy under specific circumstances, particularly when a doctor prescribes it as part of a treatment plan for a specific medical condition. To ensure coverage, clients need a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) from their doctor, indicating the medical need for yoga therapy. Yoga therapy can be billed through insurance using specific codes, and many insurance companies now recognize and cover it as a legitimate treatment option. 

## Documents needed:
1. Medical precription for Yoga (or Letter of Medical Necessity)  
2. Invoice from Therapist (that you paid)
3. You also need 'specific codes'. These will be required to be filled in your insurance reimbursement request. You may need to obtain these codes from your insurance company.

### Notes:
The specifics of how you want your reimbursement (either bank account or check) can be setup on your insurance website.  
Any deductibles/co-pay charged to you by your insurance company  are also eligible for FSA/HSA and you can submit these for reimbursement with them, if you have an FSA/HSA plan.
