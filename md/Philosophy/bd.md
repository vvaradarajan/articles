# Impressions from a 'No Kings' Protest
There were about 3000 people there in Santa Ana Centennial park. The ethnic mix seemed reflective of the california Urban population - white, brown, asian, hispanic, South American. I could recognize some Indians as well. The proportion of women to men and self identified genders were also as would be expected for California.  The atmosphere was raucus, peaceful and party like. The signs carried were by and large home-made, and the estimates are: 'Fuck Trump' - 20%, 'Crush ICE' - 30%, 'Welcome immigrants' - 5%, Democracy' - 20%, 'Where are the Epstein files' -10% miscellaneous. The one I liked was 'If Kamala had won, I would be having brunch!'. The cars passing by 'honked' away non-stop at all hours of the protest.

There were some people there, fearful and standing silently with their signs - possible highly introvert individuals, who had pushed beyond their fear of being public, but not quite! The others were loud, passionate in their support of humanity, freedom and democracy. Everyone there believed that America was going (and gone) in the wrong direction. They desperately wanted to get back to brunch, get rid of Trump and eat well in the belief that America was back to it was - a kind and gentle with all institutions doing their respective jobs.

Plenty of Videos were taken. The concern that some of these could be government surviellence seemed to be absent. However a masked 'ice agent' kept circling the park, and exactly who is behind the masked costume was not known.

We had discussed goverment surviellence. It is illegal to surviel peaceful protests, but the likelihood that it happened, given the current nastiness is high. Surviellence tools are too easy with AI face recognition, personal information databases, fast computers all of which make this an easy task for the government. We will have to wait and see if we detect retributory actions against protestors - loss of job, persection for other 'crimes', enemies-list and so on. Ironically the best protection appears to be to protest a lot, ensure that your connections with the causes of the protest (sign-up with your name etc.) are easy for public viewing. The 'first-amendment defense' then becomes more credible, when facing persecution. The more public persona also associates you with a much larger group of like-minded protestors which the government has to consider before persecution.

Was this protest of any use? The answer is yes, due to the large number of people who turned out. The mid-term 2026 is on the way and the crowd size will not favor escalation of current practices. Also the crowd-size feeds on itself and the next big protest will be bigger. Another aspect is de-moralization of ICE and National Guard implementing stupid policies. They will wonder what they are doing - far from home and essentially beating up on fellow citizens or gathering garbage (like in DC) and nothing worthwhile ahead. Of course they got a 'Job' that pays which is the other side of the coin! The current administration is trying to make that coin more valuable, by increasing cost of health-insurance, and now by the 'smart' move of paying the military during the shotdown and firing/not attempting to pay the federal workers. So de-moralization vs coin-collection. The majority will be affected by de-moralization, the reason being they probably have family wealth and benefits to begin with.

Another reason is the growing number of Trump Voters regretting their choice. Most of them express the opinion that the "Country is going in the wrong direction". This segment will be energized by the protests and most likely to cast the deciding vote in 2026.
 







It has long been argued whether change should be gradual or abrupt.  The answer is very easy, especially if it is you making the change.
Why change?  Because it ushers in a betterment.
Then a gradual change simply delays the betterment. So the answer is change Abruptly.

There is another insidious reasoning, which comes to the same conclusion. It is rooted in a disbelief about the change. The person does not believe in the change, but they are being coerced to change by external parties.  In this case, the change is not seen as a betterment. So the path of gradual change is taken to appease the coercement, and when betterment is not seen right away, discard the change indicating 'it is not working'.  No betterment is seen because the change was not completed. And in addition the idea of the particular change as resulting in a betterment has been fallaciously and conveniently proved 'wrong'. An example of this change is 'Regular exercise will result in good sleep' is discarded after just a day or two of slow walking.  that it had no effect! Change abruptly and it will be more permanent.

So in order to make a change, change abruptly! This will force the recognition and internalization of the change as beneficial.  There is no reversal here, because this change is for betterment and going backwards is a self beating.

So the motto should be ‘Always change abruptly’.
