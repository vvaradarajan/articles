MyEye

Introduction:
I don't think about my eye if I don't have a need (who does?). But now I have and found out I had multiple eye problems including in the software behind the eye in the brain. So here goes:
Analysis methodology:
Elementary Yoga is the analysis methodology. Yoga is based on dual beliefs: 1. that there exists a logic, and most of us know some it, some more than most and no-one knows all.  and 2.Then there is the factual knowledge, and again most of us know some it (laymen), some more than most (PhD's on specific topics) and no-one knows all. The Yoga method is to combine both along with the concept of 'naya', that both are the same, your logic interchangeable could be rediscovered as factual knowledge, and vice versa and come to a conclusion that allows you to move on to the next problem. This is Elementary Yoga, which stops at solving some problem. Other parts of Yoga go beyond and are in the domain of the Great Guru's, which is not me.

My problems:
Lens: The lens in the eye: These are caused by irregular shape, and lack of flexibility which helps focus. The elementary yogic analysis: logic: the eye has to focus near and far and form a 'true' image; and factual knowledge: Some lens that is flexible will work. Then the problems become clear:
The lens is not able to get into a correct shape!
 - its shape is irregular resulting in multiple images on the retina, and this is 'astigmatism' and is indicated by the 'Cly' or clyinder number on the prescription. 
 - Its flexibility is limited and cannot assume shapes to ensure clarity of images too near and too far are not focused properly on the retina. These are the 'sphere' numbers on the prescription and generally the issue may be only on the 'near' side or 'far' side, so one number suffices in most cases. Dual numbers result in 'bi-focal' or progressive lens corrections
 - 
Eye problems can be 'mapped' to parts of the eye fairly easily, except for the software, which fortunately makes up for the problems, and unfortunately obfuscates the problems until they cannot be made up for.
