# Counter reply to checkmate's reply to my request to quash subpeona
Checkmate omits/states partical facts in Statement of Facts:

## On Declaration of Rebecca I. Makitalo

Point #6: “On August 15, 2025, Plaintiff was served with Checkmate.com Inc.’s
23 Notice of Subpoena for Deposition of Vasan Varadarajan and Request for Production
24 of Documents.” – Is this true?

Points 10-15: The emails are sufficient for meet and confer. The messages from Checkmate’s counsel were adverserial made suppositions about me (Varadarajan) and this was the best way to meet and confer. I replied to each email of Checkmate counsel and no reasonable conclusion was reached.  On Sep 13th I sent in to Checkmate Counsel, my objections to the Subpeona. (See Exhibit A – Objections to Subpeona). Checkmate counsel Ryan Q. Keech replied by email on Sept 17, 2025 indicating that they are willing to “accommodate legitimate scheduling conflicts and discuss the parameters of your production”. This was further emphasized by “Makitalo, Rebecca” another member of Checkmate counsel, where it was acknowledged that I will not be appearing for the Sep 22nd deposition, given my objections and that they (Checkmate counsel) were willing to accommodate “we are willing to accommodate scheduling changes and provide for different scopes of production in order”
This makes their claim that I missed the Sep 22nd date duplicitous, and in fact they contributed to this by indicating that delay in scheduling is acceptable. 
I also reiterated my objections on Sep 19th as well. 
On September 23rd in an email, Checkmate sent a disparaging email, about my ‘retirement’ and my being un-employed, and that I better submit to their subpeona demands before my health condition ‘worsens’, rejected restricting the scope to protect my private and privileged communications with my family and friends. They also indicated that ‘what health condition you claim to have and how it affects your ability to provide testimony’. I never claimed that my health condition affects testimony, only that it should be remote. 
I will provide in-camera, private and personal information on my health condition and family situation to support my request for remote testimony.
Checkmate Counsel unilaterally laid out their conditions and dates without my consent, and then indicated that “ will be happy to discuss any of these matters with you” and demanded an agreement to their condition within ‘5:30  p.m. on Sep 24th”
On receiving my reply requiring a remote deposition, and relevant search criteria for documents, they indicated that we are at an impasse. On search criteria, I wish to point out that there are tens of thousands of emails alone, and includes messages from advertisers, family, friends, organizations of which I am a member of (utilities, banks, doctor’s offices etc.) and it is not practical to evaluate each one individually as to their relevance to Checkmate, and they indicated “You will identify documents you are withholding on privilege grounds, if any, no later than November 11, 2025”

These above summary of email correspondence indicates  my timely response to Checkmate Counsel.


## Misrepresentations in “Statement of facts” by Checkmate counsel:
1. 
Checkmate repeatedly emphasizes the "functional” code as the 'code in 
The use of the word “functional” code is code is concerned primarily with data storage and retrieval This code is based on industry standard software functions, data operations and procedures which cannot be copyrighted. I have expertise in this industry over decades  and have not claimed any copyright over this code.
I have  no expertise/experience and no role in the design and development of AI/Large Language Model code which is the core code that is the backbone or AI based ordering and automation. Large Language model is an emerging field in the industry and is highly sought after and I understand that Checkmate was interested in it as well.
This is explicitly stated in my declaration: “12. This code was functional and unrelated to the Large Language Model AI that Arjun and team were rapidly developing and offering to Checkmate.”

2. Checkmate counsel also improperly extends the context of my statement:
““longtime technical advisor and collaborator of Arjun
Vasan” and further declares to “have worked professionally with every member of
5the VoiceBite founding team at past companies, including CyborgOps and Presto.”
All of these activities occurred before the formation of Voicebite. My coding collaboration with Arjun, both professional and otherwise started around 2018 and gradually stopped stopped in 2023. Subsequently I retired Sept. 2023.  Voicebite was conceived by Arjun and his co-founders Robert Nessler and Chris .., in/around early 2024 well after my retirement.   Checkmate implication that I somehow collaborated in Voicebite is false.

3. Checkmate improperly supposes a role for me in Voicebite and insinuates improper words into my declarations:
“witnessed the co-founders “negotiat[ing] and
discuss[ing] every issue thorough and transparently” while the “VoiceBite team
w[as] finalizing the merger with Checkmate.” into negotiations.”

I was not a ‘witness’ to discussions on ‘every issue’ discussed by the Voicebite founders with checkmate. I had no role in Voicebite. My declaration clearly states that Arjun and Chris were at my house as my family and friend/guests. I only stated that I “observed” their seriousness and intensity is their discussions of their company Voicebite and the Checkmate negotiations while at my house and stated: “10. From observing, it was clear that Arjun, Christopher and Robert Nessler were equal partners in the negotiation and discussed every issue thoroughly and transparently.”
I was never in any relevant meeting either with Voicebite or Checkmate on any issue relating to their negotiations. My role was that of a host along with Arjun’s mom to family and friends.

4. Checkmate misrepresents my testimony:
My entire testimony is my declaration (Carried over from the NY case to CA by checkmate). I had clearly stated in my declaration that my part of the code was developed along with Arjun over the years before Voicebite was formed and Arjun has full authorization to use the same. Further “12. This code was functional and unrelated to the Large Language Model AI that Arjun and team were rapidly developing and offering to Checkmate.”
My declaration was made as Checkmate referred to my name being in  “single 2018 file header (e.g., the counterclaim-exhibited audio.py)”. This is only item that Checkmate has made me aware of as their ‘finding’.

A substantial portion of my declaration refers to my family concern with its son Arjun, points 15 thru 19 which appeared to be brought on by the stressful environment and treatment received at  the hands of Checkmate.  

Checkmate’s dubious and deceitful claim “B. Mr. Varadarajan’s Motion Seeks Untimely Relief After TheDate Of Compliance Indicated By Checkmate’s Subpoena”

Checkmate counsel has been in email negotiations from the time of issuance of its subpeona with respect to negotiations of the terms and place and date of deposition of the subpeona. The emails were all replied to in a timely manner, and Checkmate indicated “we are willing to accommodate scheduling changes” (email dated Sept 19) in response to my e-mail requesting a date in ‘mid-november’. Subsequently Checkmate agreed to a date of “Checkmate will agree to postpone your deposition until November 14, 2025 at 10:00 a.m., “. 
While being fully aware of the negotiations well before Sep 22nd and indicating their flexibility to scheduling, their claim that I was untimely is vacuous. It is only after Checkmate decided that “we are now at an impasse over your compliance obligations” in an email dated Sep 29, a full 7 days after Sep. 22nd  that they decided to file that I was seeking untimely relief regarding the original date of Sep 22nd.

# Counter to 'III. ARGUMENT'
## A. Checkmate’s Subpoena Seeks Tailored Discovery From Mr.Varadarajan"
1. The key sentence "Mr. Varadarajan has testified in writing and under oath, Mr.
Varadarajan has sworn to authorship and ownership over the “proprietary” code that
VoiceBite sold to Checkmate." is false as I explicitly declared that I have no claims on 'ownership' of code. Any code that I had written was co-authored with Arjun, was functional in nature and was all done well before Voicebite was formed and as I declared I have never claimed ownership.
The word "owned by Mr.Varadarajan" is used several times in the Checkmate Argument, and is false in each occurence.

2. Fact omitted in the phrase “co-
author, with Arjun, of the functional code at question.”. The functional code in question that was presented by Checkmate is a single file header from 2018 which has my name. This is one out of several items given to checkmate. No other file was presented by Checkmate as evidence.

3. Checkmate's Argument states that "Merger Agreement and related documents – negotiations which Mr.
Varadarajan claims to have been a witness". This statement should be considered false. My Declaration states that "10. From observing, it was clear that Arjun, Christopher and Robert Nessler were equal partners in the negotiation and discussed every issue thoroughly and transparently.". Arjun and Christopher were staying in my house, and I overheard parts of some conversations between Arjun, Christopher and Robert, and by the tone of these, made my observations. I never claimed to be a 'witness' to the Merger Agreement or related documents and was never part of these conversations.

4. The word 'Tailored Discovery' is misleading as Checkmate's discovery was declared as over-broad (any detail here?)

## B. Mr. Varadarajan’s Motion Seeks Untimely Relief After The Date Of Compliance Indicated By Checkmate’s Subpoena
The counter-claim is that Checkmate counsel offered to negotiate subpeona terms and continued negotiations beyond Sep 22nd and agreed to a date of Nov 14 (The emails/negotiations are included earlier in this doucment). This misled me (Mr. Varadarajan) to assuming that Sep 22nd depositon was postponed. I request the court to accept my excuse for missing this date.

## D. There Is No Basis To Quash Or Modify The Subpoena
The basis for quashing the subpoena are listed in the motion filed by me before the court. Before this filing I had written to Checkmate counsel on these objections to no avail. This included the fact that Voicebite was formed well after my retirement and Voicebite-Checkmate contracts took place after that, and that I had no claims on any code I had written prior to this period, and that I was not part of Voicebite or have had any contact with checkmate, checkmate persisted in their subpeona.
They further declined reasonable conditions on my deposition and in that process revealed a motive, which was to put family stress on Arjun Vasan the plantiff into submission in this case through him being my son.

There were behaviors in their e-mails to me and phone calls which were hostile:

1. On Sep 5th I received a call from Checkmate Counsel with no notice, and that the call was being recorded, without obtaining my consent, which is required by California Law ("two-party consent" state, meaning it is illegal to record a confidential conversation without the consent of all parties involved).
2. More than one unsolicited calls, when we were clearly communicating via email. I declined the calls as they put me under stress to respond immediately on a recorded line to their conditions, which require a thoughtful response.
3. Disparaging contents about my health condition and retirement: “If anything, the existence of “health constraints” means that Checkmate will need to take your deposition immediately before those constraints worsen any further” and “claim to be retired and thus unemployed.”
4. Further Checkmate also had a team ("Keech, Ryan Q." <Ryan.Keech@klgates.com>,"Makitalo, Rebecca I." <Rebecca.Makitalo@klgates.com>, "Chiu, Stacey G<Stacey.Chiu@klgates.com>
"Winningham, Jacob R." <Jacob.Winningham@klgates.com and Trent Haynes) with more than one person responding/negotiating the subpeona. This imposed some confusion and stress on me.
5. Recommended that I hire an attorney, but refused to pay for the expenses. They also indicated that my expenses are not significant, yet they claimed $5000 from me as a sanction and stated that their expenses in pursuing this subpoena was $15,000 (check this figure). As a retired person on Social Security this figure is highly significant, a good estimate of my attorney expenses if I hired one as they recommended. This again reinforces their intent to subject me to stress and burden Arjun Vasan (my son) with matters unrelated to this case.

## E. Cost-Shifting Is Not Justified Under Rule 45
The costs are significant for me as a non-party. The amounts as stated by Checkmate-counsel in their sanctions motion (Sanction of $5000 and their expense of $15000) for the subpeona negotiations alone. I had only asked for my costs to hire an attorney as suggested to me by Checkmate counsel, and estimate that these amounts will be my costs, and I should be paid for the legal expenses involved. As researched by Checkmate Counsel "Legal Voice v. Stormans
11Inc., 738 F.3d 1178, 1184 (9th Cir. 2013) (emphasis added). “[O]nly two considerations are relevant to the cost-shifting inquiry: (1) whether the subpoena
13imposes expenses on the non-party, and (2) whether those expenses are significant.”
Both these conditions are met here.


#Concluding request: I humbly request the court to vacate the subpeona or impose the reasonable conditions on it that I have requested.
