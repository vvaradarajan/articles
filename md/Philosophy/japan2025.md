# Japan Experience:

Went to Nagasaki, Japan – to the center of the atomic bomb. Saw a lot there, and felt the tragedy.  I saw the write up of the thought and struggle in the west before dropping the bomb. Now Japan has tried to create a monument to peace which is necessary. I have also been to Andaman Islands and viewed the testimonials of the barbaric cruelty of the Japanese of that time. The slaughter, and live burnings of human beings and other atrocities on a large scale.  

Japan today strives to be different. There is a monument outside the Museum at Nagasaki the points the way to peace. This monument is of a very muscular man, more like a world-wide wrestling prize fighter. This indicates the problem of Japan. The path to peace that it symbolizes is one of peace through muscle and brutality and not one through love and understanding. The RULE is peace, and we will all be rule-followers, and will do what we are told. If it means cruelty, so be it. 

We had a taste of this in March 2025 at the airport where some error in a document caused immediate deportation of a family member and treatment as a criminal. The family was broken at the Airport. The clean surroundings and looks of efficiency, and the uniformed and well-dressed officials were simply a facade for the cruelty being administered. A simple passport error was used to breakup a family, put all its members in some sort of torture. Contact with the detained person was prevented by neat walls, and personnel preventing passage in the pathways, and threatening dire consequences.

The Airport authorities were just following the rules! Their craniums were empty.. they cannot think! Rather than thinking through and looking for some information (there was plenty => All the other passports of the other family members were in order, and they were admitted into Japan, a tourist plan was in order, accommodation booked and in order, family has funds and the stay was only 10 days etc.) to help is alleviating the passport issue, they isolated and put the detained person, immediately back, without his luggage or belongings onto a plane out of Japanese soil. Their job of cruelty done! A family left  behind, distressed and dis-oriented in the airport in Japan I can only imagine the suffering of deportees who are less able to handle than ours! 

The idiocy continued, when we charged our cell phones from a wall socket, desperately contacting whoever we could to help.  A well dressed immigration officer with a white shirt and tie approached and told us to remove our cell-phone from the wall charger and go out two floors down and out of customs and try charging it there. This was another Airport person doing the ‘rules’.  The idea that we were desperate people looking for help through the cell phone that was draining of charge, and did not wish to be so distant from the detained family member was not in the rule, and thinking is forbidden by the rule.

The thought that we were discriminated against, because of skin-color and historical financial poverty of India is always in the back of my thoughts because of personal experience. There was this grocery store owner, who would not part with two apples from all around, because the store opens an hour later..’NO’ even if money was offered. His attitude is common, he does not want to deal with whom he considers as riff-raff.  The Japanese have and easy answer to anything out of their ‘line’ – a NO is capital letters (Hands crossed in front of their chests, or just a NO), locking of the taxi doors until the payment has been made, lack of willingness to attempt to understand a situation.  There was this Ambulance crew, who were very helpful, but would not transport a severely dehydrated family member to hospital, until a guarantee that the bill would be paid was obtained (a rule that he must follow, forget about thinking on what is happening). 

On the other hand, if you request help, it will be offered. However they may see you in difficulty and leave you alone. We had many pleasant experiences in Japan, the beauty of the land, the taste of the produce (significantly superior compared to most) the graciousness of the people, though they could not speak English.

I want to say that the Japanese have changed from what I saw in the Andaman Island. However the reality in 2025 is that they have a long way to go to become free. I do not know if they will ever feel the thrill of being free, and thinking free, since their society is now mired in flat prosperity, low birth rates, old age and probably some general malaise. Wishes to them to get up and go and think, and not use rule following as much.

# Prologue:
## Writer’s Background:
This is written by a 69 year old Indian, born rich (grew up with the Hindu gods, and friends and family and fun).

Enthused by marriage, seeking opportunity in the Middle East and a long story, journey and experience and finally America. America was the best, a place where you can breathe and feel secure the way you are. Friendly and independent people. Many/most are good to you and that is the norm.  Many Indians there and freely practicing the culture of India and America, and celebrating it. Prosperous and feeling Joy.

This was in contrast to the Middle East, where the authorities, and uncertainty, security and discrimination was a constant background concern.
 
It is only now that USA has taken a turn to hostility, with Trump in office, and it is becoming the norm. As far as I know, this is supposed to be ‘great television’ (I find depression,  and despondence at his support after watching these ‘shows’). 

This emphasizes that Law, constitution, justice and the institutions are the framework that we should rely on and somewhere ahead, once again goodness will become the norm.

Autocratic societies (Middle East, Russia..) are not at all good places to live. In general, the entire society is in a prison, and anyone free is actually in real prisons.
