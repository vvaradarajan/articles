# Memories to Forget

As we age, undoubtedly we experience the negative along with the positive - periods of severe setbacks, unsolvable crises, failures, loss and despair. And as we age, we look to the present and future and logically use only memories and experience that helps us. The rest is suppressed and perhaps forgotten, and enjoyment of life continues.

# Memories of History

Anything in which we do not have first experience of, or anyone we know has first hand experience of are 'Memories of History'.  
These are memories that are passed to thru  family tales. They are also memories that are thrust upon us by Museums that we encounter as travel attractions.

Again the reason to forget the negative parts is the same.. We need only the useful memories that help us in the enjoyment of the present and future.

# Vietnam Negative Memories

The impression that Memories of Vietnam are memories of Horror is the core story in the 'Hanoi Hilton' (Hoa Lo Prison) museum in Hanoi, and the 'War Remnants' Museum in Ho Chi Minh city.  These are memories that need to suppressed and forgotten in order to deal with today and future. The Vietnamese do this regularly as noted by their friendly behaviour, their focus on new ventures - building a beautiful subway, joint ventures with people, no matter their ancestral history, building a manufacturing power house, celebrating their Buddhist heritage - a joyous part of their history.

Therefore these Museums of War and Prisons are memories to be suppressed and forgotten, and these should be closed and sealed!

Since the horrors of Vietnam are very recent (1974) and are part of a significant portion of the life experience of Vietnames still living, it is remarkable that these do not play a part in the current Vietnamese attitude. These family stories (of lost uncles, aunts, brother, sisters, friends..) are suppressed and never passed on down to the next generation. There are many reasons given for this forgetting, the main one being one of charity - the current generation should look forward, enjoy life, and not have the opportunity to get mired in past misery. These are all documented in the series 'Vietnam: 50 Years of Forgetting' documentary.  

There is a part in this documentary where a Vietnamese writer says 'These people are not your amusement parks', chiding/accusing the producer of the documentary for delving into memories best forgotten for ill gotten entertainment!
