# I keep to Keep

In the good old days people were forgetting things and missing opportunities.. In the hum-drum current, people are forgetting things and missing opportunities.  This is not 'so what else is new?' and stop here.  

Forgetting is a necessary means to adapt to the bandwidth of our mental faculties. Without forgetting, the risk is that your mental faculties will be loaded with so many tasks and it keeps switching around from one to the other, without actually accomplishing anything significant on any task.  In computers this is called context switching and "The more frequent the context switches, the more your CPU utilization degrades".  
So it is essential to forget in order to maintain your mental utilization!  But then forgetting means missed opportunities. In the good old days innovative people who could read and write kept notes! Whenever their CPU (mental faculties) has some breathing room, they took up one task from their notes! That means that task was not forgotten, and that opportunity was not Missed! So you see, the idea of taking notes is to forget! Take that note, and remove the task from the list of things that you are currently working on! But voila! The purpose of notes is not to forget! That task is still there to be picked up when your mental bandwidth opens up again!

In the modern day world, schools have already given up on cursive writing. And paper is frowned upon.. We have no choice, but to use 'keep' the note-taking App on Android phones (or 'Notes' on Apple iPhone). I, of the free nation of Android, use Keep.  Here is my current list along with an explanation/comment on what it is. 

| Note in Keep | Explanation - Not in Keep |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| GameData for Chess | I am working on a new webapp design technique and this task is to seperate the GameData (piece positions in Chess) from the code |
| Salt | Buy salt in store |
| Tomatoes | Buy in store |
| cockroach bait | Buy in store |
| Radiator fluid | Check and refill radiator fluid in Acura and Audi. Summer has come..|
| sticks for creeper | Buy sticks from Home Depot or store to setup the trellis for creeper plants. Summer! |
| sheet metal screws for Garage door | The Garage door needs new sheet metal screws. (Some old ones broke when car was driven out with the door closed!) |

I can now forget and keep and so don't forget!
