# Dork Disc, Endcap, brake cable sleeve And Zen

That dorky dork faded plastic disk between the wheel spokes and the chain sprockets - pointed to with a knife.., what does it do? A couple of things: prevents your chain from falling off the highest sproket on to your wheel hub, which can happen if the gear shifting to the lowest gear (highest sprocket) is not that great. That fall to your hub will jam your bike and worse..  
Another is to stop oil from the chain and sprockets to splatter on the disc brakes (not in this picture, but imagine the disc on the wheel hub behind the dork disc). Oil on the disc brake will not brake very well...

# Endcaps
Found out that end caps generically cap the end of some thing for generally good purposes. Here is the wheel hub end cap:

Here is a bike wheel without the end cap:

Here it is with the end cap:

Why the end cap?  
Here the end cap is to prevent dirt entering the hub.. And to act as a spacer between the wheel and the wheel mounting on the bike frame, so that is is less likely that the wheel will rub on some part of the frame.

# Brake cable sleeve
That brake cable sleeve that covers the brake cable.. Here is a picture:

What does it do ?  
+ The sleeve is 'plugged' at its ends with endcaps that allow the cable inside to move and the sleeve maintains its length when the cable is moved by pressing the brakes. This transmits the cable movement almost 'fully' to the other end of the cable, which are the brake calipers, causing them to squeeze when pressing the brakes.  
+ Super modern brake systems, do not have a brake sleeve, but just transmit a signal to the 'hydraulic - self contained brake calipers', which then uses its own battery and triggers the hydraulics to squeeze the calipers. Here the brake sleeve has to function as a conduit for that signal. Often the conduit is nothing but air! No cable cable snags!

# Summary:  
YT bikes knows! They know the detail of biking and the details that make a bike ride smooth, sturdy and last long with minimal maintenance. The dork keeps your disc brakes clear, and bike jams less. If you don't have the dork, you are a dork! Make sure your disc brakes are clean and your gear shifting smooth - maintain them more often.  
If you don't have wheel caps, make sure you check that your wheels are not rubbing the frame, brakes etc. Besides keep your hub clean by brushing off any dirt.

# Conclusion:  
Translate the above to how to maintain you own body. Think about your joints, organs,nerves, brain and their maintenance and protection. Look into each detail. Eat, exercise, think, creativity all have many Dork disks and end caps. Vitamins, protein, fat, .. in what you eat.. Muscles, lungs, heart, bones, nerves in your exercise.. Logic, learning, emotional well being, sociability, friendliness, mental health in thinking and creativity..
