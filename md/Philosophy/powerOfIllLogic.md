# Power of illLogic

## Overview:

Over eons of human experience, many rules of logic have been discovered. Such rules have been discovered in all fields:  
science - ex: gravity  
health - eating healthy helps, exercise helps, ..  
Finance - Savings help  
social relations - respect for others, humor in conversation, maintaining contacts..  
Using this 'logic' life can progress (i.e. continue).  


Along with all these, is acknowlegment that such logic exists even if one is not aware of it. So it becomes  natural to seek it out and take advantage of the knowledge of others, become aware of the logic, learn it and use it in improving oneself. This is the reason to listen to others.
The converse is that other's believe that logic when transferred, will be followed. That expectation is a major way in directing the behaviour.  
If one does not listen to others, or fail to learn the logic, then that person cannot be controlled. Such is the power of ill-logic, you are uncontrollable and unteachable. Such a state also means that no improvements are possible.  Such people generally cannot function adequately in society, however they would have demonstrated that they are truly 'independent'. Rules of logic do not apply.

# Ill-logic

Ill-logic means that there is no path that leads 'forward'. The concept of forward does not exist. However all knowledge of human kind is discovery of logic. Therefore all people try to apply logic. These efforts will be futile when dealing ill-Logic. Nothing will succeed with ill-Logic. Such is the power of ill-Logic. Any attempt either logical or random cannot 'solve' ill-logical people. 
Ill-Logic at the extreme (ex: Will not eat food when hungry) leads to cessation of life. This is a trivial solution. The problem has disappeared.
The existing problems is where ill-logic is applied in such a way that the person is not a productive and responsible participant in Society. This is the impossible problem, because logical solutions will fail in the face of ill-logic.  
Ex: Continuously spending money and expecting savings to grow, Having no organization in keep track of objects, yet expecting to find them quickly, expecting a strong physique when not exercizing, expecting good health when eating junk food, ...  
A reasonable conclusion is where ill-logic exists, problems are in-soluble.
