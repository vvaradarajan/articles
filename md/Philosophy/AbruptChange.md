# Abrupt Change

It has long been argued whether change should be gradual or abrupt.  The answer is very easy, especially if it is you making the change.
Why change?  Because it ushers in a betterment.
Then a gradual change simply delays the betterment. So the answer is change Abruptly.

There is another insidious reasoning, which comes to the same conclusion. It is rooted in a disbelief about the change. The person does not believe in the change, but they are being coerced to change by external parties.  In this case, the change is not seen as a betterment. So the path of gradual change is taken to appease the coercement, and when betterment is not seen right away, discard the change indicating 'it is not working'.  No betterment is seen because the change was not completed. And in addition the idea of the particular change as resulting in a betterment has been fallaciously and conveniently proved 'wrong'. An example of this change is 'Regular exercise will result in good sleep' is discarded after just a day or two of slow walking.  that it had no effect! Change abruptly and it will be more permanent.

So in order to make a change, change abruptly! This will force the recognition and internalization of the change as beneficial.  There is no reversal here, because this change is for betterment and going backwards is a self beating.

So the motto should be ‘Always change abruptly’.
