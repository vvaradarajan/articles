# Abrupt Change

It has long been argued whether change should be gradual or abrupt.  The answer is very easy, especially if it is you making the change.
Why change?  Because it ushers in a betterment.
Then a gradual change simply delays the betterment. So the answer is change Abruptly.

There is another insidious reasoning, which comes to the same conclusion. It is rooted in a disbelief about the change. The person does not believe in the change, but they are being coerced to change by external parties.  In this case, the change is not seen as a betterment. So the path of gradual change is taken reluctantly to handle the coercion. This process results in a reversal of change once the coercion is removed.  The power to reverse is ready, since there is no belief that the change is for the better. This results in no change at all!

So in order to make a change, change abruptly! This will force the recognition and internalization of the change as beneficial.  There is no reversal here, because this change is for betterment and going backwards is a self beating.

So the motto should be ‘Always change abruptly’.
