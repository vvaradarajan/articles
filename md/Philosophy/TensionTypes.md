# Different Types of Tension

We all know that there are different kinds of stress and tension. The following is an explanation of why this occurs, and that it has its roots in our Brains attempts to minimize its workload and yet be effective at survival.
Generally physical tension can be measured clinically. Ex:  An unduly high heart rate and high blood pressure (These two measures have a correlation and a logical relation=> rapid heart rate is required to pump blood when the blood vessels are partially blocked resulting in high blood pressure. However   they also occur when exercising, where high heart rate is expected.

So does exercise cause the same kind of tension as a blocked artery?
No..Most people will agree that the blocked artery is more tension, than exercise.
This is the clue that different types of tension exist, though they may have the same physical symptoms. In the case of exercise the cause of the physical symptoms are easily understood. The other one  is not easily understood. The one that is difficult to understood, causes the brain to work in circles attempting to understand, and that is mental tension. The one that is understood (IE. the exercise) causes very little mental tension.

Why should the brain run-around in circles when it cannot understand? The reason is that understanding, makes the brain use less resources such as memory. When something cannot be understood, every aspect of what occurred is stored. This is the natural mechanism of learning, and adapting and preparing for action in case it occurs again. This amount of memory requires a lot of energy, which we call running-around, and the brain is tense. To deal with this, it attempts to 'understand', which is finding a rule to eliminate extraneous information.  Once that is found, extraneous information is discarded and memory required is reduced, resulting in lessening of 'tension'.

Sigmund Freud has alluded to this in his book 'Civilization and its discontents' wherein he describes one of the main motives of living beings is 'avoidance of pain'.  The brain is 'pained' by its heavy load, and 'understanding' is way of minimizing that load while keeping track of essential information.
Yoga alludes to this and describes ways to reduce tension...'observe the results, yet not get attached to it' is an exhortation to examine the results and find the reasons with no emotion involved. This is a key to understanding, and as reasoning succeeds, tension reduces. Yoga also recognizes that many problems are not understandable, and provides techniques of reducing the memory to retain them, by asking for 'acceptance' rather than spending efforts in finding the reasons.  This ‘acceptance’ is a way of stopping  the brain’s need to process  all information needed and using memory. 

From the above we can attempt a mathematical equation:
Total tension = physical tension + mental tension.
Here the mental tension is minimized by ‘understanding’, or even made zero, by not being aware of the mental tension which leads to the cliché “Ignorance is bliss”.
