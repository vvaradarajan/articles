Thesis Title: The connection between Yoga Theory and the Nervous systems in the body

Overview:
Yoga emphasizes the flow of energy through Nadis (energy channels) and Chakras (energy centers) and removal of knots/blocks preventing the flow of this energy. Yogic practices like breathwork (pranayama), movement (asana), and meditation consciously channel and balance prana, or vital life force energy, to enhance physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
Modern Science has identified the many physical pathways to all parts of the body, and labelled them as many systems - the circulatory systems consisting of arteries and veins, the endocrine system for hormonal control of body organs, the nervous system for carrying signals etc. Collectively these systems provide the organism life. They are the transports of the life force, the  'prana' of Yoga.

One of them, the nervous system has gained prominence recently has placed more emphasis on the signalling system (the Nervous system). The emerging thought is that the nervous system provides is both the conduit and the controller (brain) for maintaining the balance in the body. All other 'autonomous'  systems in the body such as the circulatory systems, the hormononal systems (endocrine systems in all vital organs in the body) will not operate properly if there are blocked/impaired nervous system signalling and processing (brain). This is a major component of all chronic diseases.

Advances in Computer Science and data-processing and the knowledge gained from the development of numerous data-processing systems, including cloud computing have triggered a logical modelling of the systems within the human body.  This logical model is of information from the organs in the body being sent as signals to the central processing unit and processing software, which is the brain and the controlling signals being sent back to the organs. Medical science has long identified the signalling pathways of information to the brain (neurons are unidirectional) and the path back from the brain. Using this model, the nervous system is divided into the input set, which are the sensory nerves, the output sets: sympathetic and parasympthetic. Current modern medicine's major concern is with the Vagus nerve (The parasympathetic), since it promotes a calming influence on the body (slows heartrate, breathing, relaxed muscles..) and brings it into a restful state.

Yoga on the other hand, is cognizant of the entire entire network. Various Asanas sensitize the nerves to both internal and external signals, meditation for proper processing of the received signals, and again various asanas and pranayama to strengthen and increase awareness of the body to execute the tasks sent out by the brain. Much research has been conducted experimentally to show that Yoga improves the effectiveness of the entire nervous path in the body.

It should also be noted that Yoga specifically includes the brain as an organ as a source/destination of signals and includes practices to calm the mind.  As such Yoga addresses psycho-somatic illness where mental stress manifests as physical illness.  


This study is a research study of the nervous systems and nervous signal processing, and their connection to the Yoga practices. The Yoga practices arise from the theory of yoga, which logically deduces the necessities of wholesome physical and mental well-being. Relating this to the physical nervous system, the electrical tranmission of information to the brain and processing there for suitable response, is needed both for acceptance and integration of Yoga into current medical practices. Moreover this research study will also further activity in detecting the impacts of removing the blocks through Yoga on specific chronic conditions.

Methodology:

Literature study of the nervous system, the mapping and routes of the nerves in the entire body. All three systems - the sensory,  the parasympathetic and the sympathetic will be examined and related to Yoga practices. The target is a map/cross-reference of each Yoga Practice from Pranayama to Asana's to each part of the nervous system. In Yoga the nadi's are the most comparable to the nervous system, and the signal flow through the nerve axons are similar to the flow of Prana in Yoga. Each of the ten Nadi's of yoga are can be balanced using the Yoga practices.  We can claim that the balance of the Nadi's in Yoga is equivalent to a properly functioning nervous system. On Yoga chakras, these are the 'junctions' in flow of Prana. The closest similar entity in the nervous system to the chakras are the nerve bundles, that major ones of which are located along the spine. The chakras of Yoga go beyond the nerve bundles and are points where blockages can occur. Most Chakras is related to one or more body parts and when a chakra is blocked, the associated body part does not function properly. The yoga mudras are hand positions, that can help to bring focus to the chakras and remove the blocks. What we know from modern medicine is that the hands have a very complex network of nerves and communication that allows us to discern temperature, shape, and other complex attributes such as 'feel' etc. The study of the Hand is a distinct speciality in Modern medicine. In this study, we will trace the nerve paths between the Mudra and how it could affect each Chakra - body part.
The chakras that are related emotional, and spiritual well-being are not related to specific organs in the body. These are related to the logical/computational processes within the brain and can be considered to be similar to computer software. The related yoga mudras remove 'contradictions' (or bugs) in this software and perhaps even enhancement. Here we will be looking for research studies that indicate the effectiveness of Yoga mudras to help people overcome emotional and mental stress or challenges to improve their emotional/mental well being.

In the course of this research study, I will be consulting with practicing Medical professionals and Medical faculty/researchers at the Local University and elsewhere. Much of the work will be to search through and examine published results on the effectiveness of Yoga Practices, specifically those relating to the nervous system.

Expected positive outcome:
A publised paper in a reputable academic journal. Magazine articles and a You-tube video to disseminate information and results.
This paper will serve as a reference material for all Yoga Practioners. Further it is hoped that this paper will stimulate further research along related paths to advance Yoga.
Enhanced Medical treatment of Chronic diseases via acceptance that they can be helped significantly by Yoga. Nerve blocks prevent/impair messages from reaching the brain. Therefore the brain cannot administer/control the organ causing various malfunctions.  Yoga asanas and pranayama remove these blocks and hence promote proper functioning.
Background: HIS nerve block in the heart.  Here is how it works:
Mechanism of Action:
Sensory Input: Sensory neurons detect stimuli, such as touch, pain, temperature, and light. They convert these stimuli into electrical impulses. Here the sensory input comes from the sympathetic system. Signals from the internal organs go through the parasympathetic system. 
Transmission: These impulses travel along the nerve fibers, which are insulated by a myelin sheath that speeds up conduction. 
Signal Processing: The impulses reach the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), where they are processed and interpreted. 
Motor Output: Motor neurons carry instructions from the brain to muscles, organs, and glands, causing them to respond. 

Dear Counsel,

It appears that you have not read my email in its entirety. I have family obligations and health constraints, and will be available only after Mid November, and any deposition must only be remote and time limited and pertaining only in reference to the business transaction as outlined in the case. I have to be home in Cerritos for to look after a elderly relative. Sometime after Mid November, I will be available remotely as indicated for the subpeona purposes.

I also need time to consider and avail of legal representation if that is necessary.

Please note the other contents of your email are speculative and unsubstantiated and my reply here is only to my availability. Nothing I wrote contradicts anything declared in the New York Action (I have not submitted any testimony in California). My statements regarded my peripheral knowledge of the transaction, my son's physical presence in California, and that I had no claims on any code at issue--all of which you had disputed. 

By contrast, your subpoena purports to seek documents well outside my testimony, and is facially overbroad--and would sweep in private family communications, health matters and privileged materials that have nothing to do with this case. 

Mr. Varadarajan,

 

Thank you for your message.  We refer you to our colleague’s voicemail of this morning and follow-up email sent at 1:40 p.m. today.  Your attempt to put off any obligation to respond until an undefined time “after Mid November” is not acceptable.  We wish to avoid having to bring a motion to hold you in contempt in order to enforce the subpoena, but we can confirm that persistent noncompliance will ultimately leave no choice.  Accordingly, we please ask that you please describe, with specificity, the “family obligations and health constraints” you describe below and explain how they prohibit your production or appearance now but will be resolved so as to permit your appearance at an undefined time “after Mid November.”  If anything, the existence of “health constraints” means that Checkmate will need to take your deposition immediately before those constraints worsen any further.  Please also either confirm that you are not able to leave your house in Cerritos for any reason or explain the condition that prevents you from leaving your house in Cerritos for some purposes but not to attend a deposition.  Checkmate will, of course, accommodate any condition you may have by, among other things, permitting you to take frequent breaks during deposition proceedings.   

 

We ask that you please also describe your “private family communications, health matters and privileged materials” that you believe are not subject to discovery.  Otherwise relevant and responsive documents are not excluded from discovery because you consider them to be “private family communications.”  And with respect to “health matters,” the subpoena with which you were served does not seek any information relating to your personal health; your son, however, has put his health condition at issue in his case.  Finally, Checkmate is not seeking privileged materials but will of course require the identification and description of any material being withheld on privilege grounds so as to evaluate the propriety of that statement.  Checkmate confirms that it will work with you to minimize burden and ensure the prompt production of relevant and responsive materials.

 

You are a relevant witness who has been served with a subpoena, which is to be treated as an order of the Court.  You may not simultaneously insert yourself into your son’s claims and defenses by providing sworn testimony asking the Court to accept your status as a relevant witness and then hide from discovery so that the parties may examine the basis of what it is you say.  Because this is a serious matter, we urge you to seek and obtain independent legal counsel immediately so as to discharge your obligations promptly and completely, and look forward to a response to our colleague’s communications.

 

Best regards,

Dear Counsel,
I indicated 'Mid November' with the conventional meaning of after the beginning of the 2nd week of November, at any suitable time. If you wish we can fix it at Nov 14, 2025, 10:00 AM Friday. Also note that you had requested a suitable time and this is suitable for me. I have not missed any mutually agreed meeting date or time, because there has not been any so far. Therefore your accusatory 'put off any obligations' comment is unwarranted. I have responded to the subpeona and corresponded with my concerns in a timely manner.

I had also indicated in my emails that my role in this case in entirely peripheral and that this is an onerous burden and intrusive to my privacy in my retirement. I have nothing to do with Checmate or have any claims on any code. I find your statement "You are a relevant witness" entirely speculative. 

You seem to emphasize that  I am "Arjun's Dad" and further made a disrespectul and nasty comment "If anything, the existence of “health constraints” means that Checkmate will need to take your deposition immediately before those constraints worsen any further".  Your team has also made several phone calls and left high pressure messages, "conversations are being recorded", calling me at times we had not agreed upon, while implying that I had 'missed' the call. In your email you also expressed that I "have contradicted myself in the email with my 'sworn' testimony. I have noted these undue pressure activities on me and will reaffirm them as appropriate.

While you indicate " Checkmate is not seeking privileged materials" the overbroad description in the Subpeona does exactly that. 
I reiterate that my availability as above. I have family obligations and health constraints, and will be available only in November as indicated above, and any deposition must only be remote and time limited and pertaining only in reference to the business transaction as outlined in the case. My health matters and family obligations are priveleged information. Also I note that November is highly reasonable and well within the schedule of the case.

Sincerely,

While you indicate " Checkmate is not seeking privileged materials" the overbroad description in the Subpeona does exactly that. 
I reiterate that my availability is as above. I have family obligations and health constraints, and will be available only in November as indicated above, and any deposition must only be remote, with topics limited to 2024 onwards (before which voicebite and checkmate had no relationship) and to 5 keyword search terms with 1 month windows. For example “checkmate” and may 2024. My health matters and family obligations are off limits, as is my son’s health information. These must be excluded from the five search terms. 

Also I note that November is highly reasonable and well within the schedule of the case.

Further, I currently have no regular income other than Social Security and any attorney’s fees required to respond to Checkmate’s subpoena must be advanced prior to deposition.

All, Read Mom's PhD thesis proposal. Computer program design, Engineering Control systems, Mathematical conclusions (incompleteness theorem..) all lead to the concept that there is a logic AND all the systems we see, feel etc. are one implementation of this Logic.  Yoga is the logic, and luckily it was developed without being distracted by the physical implementation details. Mom's thesis is to link the logic of Yoga to the physical systems (nervous, circulation, brain, hormone..), focusing on the nervous system. Much more info in there..so read it..

Lawyer's Letter
Mr. Varadarajan,

 

Thank you for your message.  As you know, it has now been more than a month since you were served with the subpoena on August 14, 2025.  You did not appear for your deposition on Monday, September 22.  Nor have you produced any documents.  You did not appear to be otherwise occupied on Monday – indeed, you claim to be retired and thus unemployed.  And while you reference a health condition, you have not specified what that health condition is, provided any information about why it is that purported health condition permits you to leave the house for certain conditions and not others, why that health condition prevents you from producing documents but allows you to send emails like the below, why that health condition would improve, and not worsen, between now and November, or why that health condition could not be accommodated with, among other things, permitting you to take frequent breaks during your deposition.

You have thus not complied with your obligations imposed by this subpoena.  And as we have now repeatedly explained, the law forbids you from submitting sworn testimony claiming to be a relevant witness but refusing to comply with discovery arising from your submission of such testimony.  Checkmate further rejects the limitation of document production to “five search terms” and your attempt to force Checkmate to pay for an attorney, though you are welcome to retain one at your own expense. 

Checkmate will, however, agree to the following in one last good faith attempt to obtain your voluntary compliance:

1. Checkmate will agree to postpone your deposition until November 14, 2025 at 10:00 a.m., which deposition will take place in person at our offices in Los Angeles as noticed. 
2. Checkmate will use the deposition for purposes of taking relevant discovery and rejects your attempt to define the scope of or topics to be covered during the deposition prior to the deposition taking place.  Checkmate will, however, permit the taking of frequent breaks and will further consider, subject to your provision of information as to what health condition you claim to have and how it affects your ability to provide testimony, other potential steps to ensure you are accommodated;
3. You will submit your production of relevant and responsive documents no later than close of business on November 10, 2025.  Our team will address the scope of the requests with you in order to minimize burden, but no otherwise relevant and responsive documents may be withheld because they are “private family communications”; and
You will identify documents you are withholding on privilege grounds, if any, no later than November 11, 2025.    
 
Our team will be happy to discuss any of these matters with you.  Absent confirmation of your agreement to the foregoing by 5:30 p.m. on September 24, 2025, Checkmate will proceed with a request that the court hold you in contempt.

Thank you and best regards,

K&L Gates LLP

Dear Counsel,

Thank you for your message and the agreement to postpone deposition until November 14. 

I have already notified you in my past correspondence that I would not be able to travel or meet on September 22nd and therefore your emphasis on that is redundant. Also it is presumptious of you to state "You did not appear to be otherwise occupied on Monday – indeed, you claim to be retired and thus unemployed".

Regarding the other points in your email. Once again my role in this case in entirely peripheral and that this is an onerous burden and intrusive to my privacy . I have nothing to do with Checmate or have any claims on any code. My being a witness to anything at all relevant to this case is entirely speculative and resembles a random fishing expedition. My privacy, health, my son's health, private family communications, all of which have no relevance to this case will remain private and out of bounds. 
To that extent: 
Topics must be limited to 2024 onwards (before which voicebite and checkmate had no relationship) and limited to 5 keyword search terms with 1 month windows.
The deposition must be remote. I had indicated the reasons for this being limitations imposed by my health.
The remote session must be time limited to 2 hours maximum excluding any breaks which shall in total not exceed 15 minutes.
The five keyword terms including the period of length one month should be indicated to me at least 15 days prior to Nov 10. In addition if you are aware of any specific document that fits these constraints you must let me know what they are at least 15 days prior to Nov 10.
The November dates as put forward in your email are agreeable within the above constraints.

I currently have no regular income other than Social Security and have no support team.  Any attorney’s fees required to respond to Checkmate’s subpoena must be advanced 15 days prior to deposition. This is especially relevant as you may persist in the overbroad description in the Subpeona, and my privileged and private materials need legal protection.

There shall be no production of any document beyond these constraints, absent a court order.

If for any reason your counter claims are cancelled or dismissed prior to this deposition, this deposition becomes cancelled.

Sincerely,

Vasan Varadarajan
