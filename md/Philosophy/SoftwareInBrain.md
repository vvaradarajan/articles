# Software construction and destruction in the Brain

## Importance
We all know that without software, the computer just sits there and does nothing.. The same is true of the human body - without the software in the brain, it is a dead heap!  Pretty much everything in the body works via software. Errors in the software are many times the root cause of chronic illness - something is not coded right. Secondly we know that software exerts an enoromous energy requirement (look at all the energy sucked up by AI - enough to supply entire neighborhoods to cities!) and therefore it must be controlled in an optimal manner. This is critical to operate properly - excessive software running in the brain, causes delays and bizarre responses! Imagine someone lifting a hand to catch a ball that was thrown yesterday! That is **schizophrenia**! Imagine too little software running - inability to properly observe and react.. That could be **ADHD**!

## Software Construction
In a short version "Learning is where connections between neurons (synapses) are created, strengthened, or weakened in response to new experiences. As new information is processed, the brain builds and strengthens neural pathways, making them more efficient over time through repetition".  Exploring this statement, a connection is created when a new experience occurs. When that connection is used again (the same experience occurs again) the connection is strengthened, or we can imagine two connections along the same path.  An experience is the observation of an event, a reaction to it, and observing the outcome. Strengthening is the same event and the same reaction repeated (Guess You will repeat the reaction if you like the outcome which is a good learning)

## Software Destruction
This takes place not actively, but through disuse. Just do not repeat your reaction to the observation of the same event, and that learning dies out. This is physically accomplished by destroying the neuronal connection, by the immune system "with specialized immune cells (microglia) tagging and clearing weak synapses, guided by activity (or lack of) and signaling molecules like C1q"

## Conclusion
What can we do? Can we make drugs to help in 'good' software construction and 'bad' software destruction? Probably yes and research has to be done.  
Of more promise is the 'repeat of the reaction'. First make a reaction - i.e. Be in a place where the experience will occur and then react. Do this often as you can. Also memorize (i.e. use the auto-repeat feature of imagination) when the experience cannot be repeated to strengthen the connection.  This will also help in destruction of the wrong reaction, as that will not be activated and hence tagged with C1q and destroyed.

# Sample applications:
Overcoming lethargy: When an experience occurs (i.e. a task come up) react as soon as you can. Repeat! Soon the lethargy will disappear. For the repetition to happen you must experience again, or use your imagination.
Overcoming diabetes: When you see sweets, react by turning away. Repeat!
Encouraging Friendliness: Create an experience (i.e. call/meet etc.) and react with something pleasant. Repeat! ...
Enhancing Sporting Skills: Create an experience (like practice) and react the way that improves your skill. Repeat! ...
