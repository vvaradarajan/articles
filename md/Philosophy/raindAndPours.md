# When it rains, it POURS!

Rain is generally a good thing. The subject of this write up is about bad things. Especially as you notice that when one bad thing happens, another one follows and then another.. It seems that a collection of them were just waiting for the first domino to fall.

I have noticed this by experience and attempted a logical explanation. The first bad thing stresses you out and mistakes are made and due to that the next one happens. This explanation works only very rarely. For ex: Don’t drive fast to the repair shop to repair your failed brakes! Another is when you transfer the stress from one situation to another, and now you have multiple situations to deal with.  Once this logical explanation sinks in, we know how to proceed.

Unfortunately there are times when things unrelated turn bad in quick succession. Ex: Your induction stove goes bad. While trying to fix that, the water starts leaking, and the next thing you know the power is out. Then your credit card is declined, you fall sick and/or somebody is not well and all of these occur in quick enough succession to put you in a situation of multiple crises.

The times when you had a single problem pales in comparison to times when multiples of them occur simultaneously.

I have not found an explanation for this yet. That is when you begin to understand quantum pairing! Is it possible that there is an invisible  fourth dimension in which there is a relation between all of these. In that dimension a water leak in your house causes your friend/relative living hours/countries away to suddenly fall sick. And that this mechanism is fully explained in a yet undiscovered science? 

While in pursuit of that fourth dimension, the problems still have to he handled.
 Just bear with it. Devise a process of dealing with the situation – fix the one completely, before moving onto the next.  Choose the easiest one first. Call for and accept help. Do whatever, but do! In the meanwhile don’t miss out or postpone the fun stuff. Watch that movie, go to that party, play the sport, indulge in intellectual pursuits. Also while doing what needs to be done, try to ensure the longevity of your fixes, and also hope that the storm passes.  The storm always passes, because you are determined and will be there when it ends.
