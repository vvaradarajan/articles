# Stealing from our Children

A while ago, when school systems were not as developed as now I was often very late for school pretty much every day. The way to school was full of interesting things, and the most interesting were the street entertainers, snake swallowers, fire throwers, acrobats, guys with heads in the ground with their body and limbs sticking out, the Burma bazaar with curious objects.. that was the way it was in the late 1960’s. A little money can be earned, and kids always looking on, eyes wide open, soaking up the fun. School discipline was not a problem, just a signature from my dad indicating that he received notice of lateness, which I duly forged.

Today such things are not possible, and our children have this experience stolen from them. School systems too strict, PTO’s all active and children all constrained.   Whether this is ‘stealing from our Children’ will be debated by many, to which I say “Bring it back, and we shall let the children decide! Definitely better than being imprisoned in classrooms!.” 

It is undebatable, however that we are stealing the following from our children..

## A Decent Earth:  
Anyone today who is over 60 years of age remembers how much greener the earth was, the forests and the animals. A walk through the woods, a sense of wonder at observing the snakes, monkeys, leapords; marvel at pristine environments. We have stolen these with our greedy ‘drill, baby drill’ policy, mindlessly destroying delicate and undisturbed environments, wanton destruction of wildlife, all to shave a few cents off our gas bills. Take the most, leave the least and deprive our children of these wonders and the gas beneath.
What we have known for a while is that there is no limitless Earth. While we have grown, the earth has remained what it was, the same size.. No more land for forests and animals, no more oceans for aquatic beings. Simple science indicates that the gases we put in the atmosphere, stay there and even cumulate, while the container Earth is the same size.Increasingly polluted earth, and nowhere for the heat to go. Withdrawing from the ‘Paris Agreement” continues this pillage of our children’s assets.  
Simply put, we stole the wonders of our planet from our children.

## Religion: 
It is way of living a good life. Generosity towards fellow inhabitants, creating an environment that is friendly, and everyone on a pursuit of happiness is the cornerstone of democracy. Through immigrant bashing, creating divisions to promote hate, denial of civil rights and due process we now have a society of hostility. Good Living and generosity has been stolen from our children.

## Economy: 
We trade to benefit from the work of one-another. The creativity of one benefits the other and prosperity is universal. We have created a system to tax these transactions and channeling the rewards into the pockets of oligarchs and have stolen a great economy from our children.
Simply put we have stolen the joy of creativity and cooperation and promoted greed and retribution.

## Honesty: 
A system prone to lying, is one in which a future cannot be based. Abandoning honesty is to turn one’s back on thoughtful planning. It is a withdrawal from looking forward to a good future, and let things fall where they may. It is the stealing of the future from children.
Simply put we have stolen the pre-requisite of thoughtful planning which requires honesty.
