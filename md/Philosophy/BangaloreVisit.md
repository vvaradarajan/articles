# Bangalore Visit 2024

The festivities of the wedding and party was planned. You saw all the pictures in WhatsApp. 

This is about the other part of which always occasionally occupied my thoughts – that of physical aging, diabetes, health complications.  These came to the fore in the same Bangalore visit..

## Physical Aging

I visited people in the late 80’s and 90’s by age, all close relatives of ours. For now, I will refer to them as ‘them’. Most of them mentally sharp, but physically severely limited. Inability to move around, lack of communication, fairly cut-off from social interactions. No way to get out of the living area (apartment) or to engage in normal activities without assistance.

There were two different parts to their motivation – one to enjoy what they had, which is philosophy, watching TV, having a pain-free few hours, making the most of social visits (when somebody visits them). Those who were not mentally sharp, or had hearing loss also had the same motivations.

The second part was a motivation to get this phase over with expressed quite frequently as a desire for the ‘lord’ to call them to him and remove the earthly connection.

From a human perspective, both of these combine into a desire to have a full life till the end.  This is the way it was in the past. The reason from an  engineering perspective, is the physically body systems have  redundancy and compensating abilities for failures. So ‘All’ functions work, even when some individual system is not functioning properly. For those failing systems, other systems compensate, and the person themselves add to this compensation by changing their behavior.  They are able to tolerate a system failure, and it has minimal effect on their functioning. Therefore when functioning starts failing, it means multiple systems (the base system, and the redundant and compensating systems) have failed. In the years past the end would swiftly follow.

Today, medical technology and modern conveniences ameliorate multiple system failure. Ex: If you cannot walk (both legs fail) get a wheel chair. Food can be delivered if the person is not able to get it themselves. Effects of Diabetic (insulin) failure can be compensated with insulin etc. These result in the ability of a person to live for a significant time, with multiple system failures. However this life is functionally impaired. And that is the reason for the dual motivation – the motivation to make the most of what you, and the desire for the ‘lord’ to call them to him (or her?).

There is the famous Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD, who analyzed the above in more detail and decided that he should not get any medical treatment after 75. Essentially he reasoned that he will optimize his life, live well with full functionality, until multiple system failure occur swiftly bringing the natural end. 

The conclusion here is similar => Do what you can to keep All your systems in good shape.. weight bearing exercises to keep bones in shape, running to keep cardio in shape, count what you eat, supplements where lacking, social and intellectual activities , competitive sports (even in recreation) for enjoyment of competition..

Turning to the difficulties of doing this in India. There are many systemic issues in India, which make this nearly impossible. The pollution, no space to be physically active, commuting is through traffic and vehicle emissions, social interaction is severely impacted due to long commutes, efforts involved and lack of physical space to have these interactions.  Further, food habits are what they were, and attention is not paid to the nutritional content. (This is unfortunate, because all kinds of fruits, grains, beans, legumes and vegetables are plentiful). 

In contrast,  in US, all this is easily within reach, even more today with the prevalence of ‘work from home’.  The parks, recreational facilities, time for social activities, all kinds of tools (induction stove, air fryer, microwave are all standard), a great deal of awareness of nutritional content. (Also in California, the climate is an added benefit).

## Diabetes and Other:

It so happened that Diabetes was emphasized during this visit. Chemba-mami (Kasturi Uncle’s wife) died from complications – gangrene in both feet, internal infections and organ failure – all in great pain. I also met Shyam (who visited us in Cerritos). He is highly diabetic, and used to drink quite a bit. He also had pancreatitis. He spoke with me for 20 minutes, and then excused himself. He said he was in a great deal of pain in most parts of his body. When he visited in Cerritos for 1-2 days, he was strong. He told me at that time that he had gotten into a bar-fight etc. Now I could not recognize him, very frail, could barely walk, and in great pain.

In the Hindu tradition, there is a ‘fate’ that is believed to dictate a person’s life and one that cannot be changed. Now as we know modern science, we know better. In both situations above, Diabetes probably could not have been prevented, but once known, it can be handled better. Complications can be avoided, by proper attention to food, exercise and medication. Jog, sprint, play and eat less is the motto. Gangrene, infections could have been avoided. In Shyam’s predicament, pancreatitis could have been minimized by not drinking. He has stopped, but now suffering the effects of both pancreatitis and diabetes.

I think if both had lived in the US, the chances are that they would not have had these complications. India ‘knows’, but unfortunately is often mired in all other difficulties and not able to implement its knowledge. Hopefully positive changes that are taking place will be rapid.

Again the conclusion to this ‘Diabetes and other’ is the same:
Do what you can to keep All your systems in good shape.. Make it your regular lifestyle.
