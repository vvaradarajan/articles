# Hate Political and Personal and the media fuel

Hate is ravaging our life, whether you like it or not. This is a new kind of hate, one that is not related to anything, just 'pure'.  It is directed toward any group on which some attribution can be made. These groups are immigrants, illegal immigrants, people differt either by religion or by color, people of specific ethnicities like Jews, Indians and so forth. The USA has all these groups in significant numbers.

How is this ravaging our lives? Isn't it something you can ignore and continue on your merry way? This is where numbers come in. Almost 45% of the population is consumed by this. At this percentage, it is reasonable to assume that about 1 person in each family is affected. Further since this hate is based on lies, this one person in each family operates on the belief that lies are the truth. This is generally the psychologically impacted person. Their world is consumed by hateful TV programs, print, social media in which they spend an in-ordinate amount of time.  With that view the family is torn, normal activities become angry outbursts, things get neglected and difficulties mount. Life is intolerable..

Reflect on this from a person growing up in the 1950's and 1960's in India.
Poverty was rampant. There were beggars knocking on your door each night, asking for food with the words 'oosina arisi kudungamma.. pasikuthama' meaning asking for food that is rotten from the lady of the house.  Lepers begging lined the gates to your school. Cheating on a small scale was normal. Like mixing water and milk. Paying jobs were hard to get. Freedom and happiness was irrelevant for day to day life. Survival dominated.

In that condition immigration to the USA was a godsend. When opportunity arrived, it was seized instantly, years spent building a good, prosperous life, and indulging in pleasures and personal pursuits as possible.

In all these years aging took a toll, and as abilities waned, the hate mentioned above has emerged, attacked the weakest person in the family, and soon all is miserable. Since this hate is based on lies, solutions cannot be reasoned, meaning we don't have any solutions at all. To go further this hate is ironic, since life is good materially, entertainment is in plenty, sports, cultural occasions, intellectual challenges are freely available.  The only logical way for this hate to exist is to base it on lies. Lies conveniently aimed at other groups like immigrants, illegal immigrants, people different by way of religion or by color, people of specific ethnic origins like Jews, Indians, Haitians and so forth.  The lies don't matter, but the family is miserable and destroyed.

Now how about people who grew up in the USA, the 'natives' who grew up in prosperity? The same hate is ravaging them as well. One unfortunate difference is their access to guns that seem natural to them. The school shootings, and gun violence is a small symptom of this hate. The bigger picture is that of broken families and people struggling to make sense of things, in the midst of material prosperity.

So, there is no cause or origin for this hate. It is simply affecting 45% of the population all over. Misery by itself..
