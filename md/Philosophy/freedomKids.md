That I know! They came from rain. Scouts! Look up! Do you see any clouds? There cannot be rain!.. What? Rain drops are falling!  We are getting wet! This is Magic!


I know what you are thinking.. Let us keep seeing more magic! But we are in the blue and gold Scout celebration..not a magic show!

Ok.  What I showed you were tricks! The real magic in within you. And the real magic is happening right before us.  The magical transformation of a pack of curious and adventurous beginners being into purposeul, energetic, Webelos Scouts, looking forward to a great life and real magic. This parents and all of you cubscouts, is the real magic! 

Tonight, we celebrate a very special occasion â€“ the graduation of our Webelos Scouts, as they cross the bridge to begin their journey in Scouts BSA. We gather here to acknowledge the hard work, dedication, and growth these Scouts have demonstrated throughout their time in Cub Scouting.
As they cross this bridge, they are not leaving the pack! Pack..the are giving you the direction, and stirring up the magic within each of you, that you can also do these wonderful things.  They are entering a new chapter filled with exciting adventures and challenges. They will now wear the girl Scout neckerchief, a symbol of their commitment to the Scout Oath and Law, and the values of Scouting.
Troop 394 will provide them with opportunities to explore the outdoors, learn valuable skills, and develop leadership qualities. They will face new challenges, overcome obstacles, and grow into confident, capable young women.
As they cross the bridge, let us remember the lessons learned in Cub Scouting, the friendships forged, and the memories made. May they carry these experiences with them as they embark on their new Scouting journey.
We, the Cub Scout leaders, the Scout leaders, and the parents, are here to support them every step of the way. We encourage them to embrace the challenges, seek out opportunities, and never stop learning and growing. We believe in Magic!
Congratulations, Webelos Scouts! We wish you all the best on your new adventure in Scout troop394 !"
