The above did not work probably because the also device was wrong. So recorded with OBS (sound only selected and it created an .mkv file)

Today is an event of paramount importance in Scounting. This is so big, that I am rendered speechless! And I have to speak. In that nervousness, my feet were were shivering in their shoes. Intensely thinking but only silence coming forth. You are not going to listen to silence! Eventually  the night fell and I went to bed with an empty head!
Gentlepeople, I had a dream! A dream that one day we will be appreciated for the content of our Character.. No.That is Martin Luther King's dream..Different dream that came with Music..
(Play Music..-20 seconds)
That is it! The Magnificent seven! Now unleashed onto the world! What is happening? Is it Good or something else.. I let my dream continue..what will the magnificent seven do! And now my dream continued in Verse.. 

"Oh! my baby locked in the hot car"
Spied the Eagle from afar!
A mighty fist causing window to Smash!
The baby is saved, by none other than Yash!
Yash Samineni.. that is..
---
A kid in the neighborhood attempting smoking..
Said the Eagle..Go join Scouting, Learn Hiking and go Biking!
Refrain from bad habits you Shall..
My name is Vishal!
Visha Sivakumar.. that is.
---
"Is there money for my Charity?"
My budget lacks clarity"
The eagle using data skills, found the funds bit by bit..
Was non other than Mohit!
Mohit Banda .. That is..

---
A group of boys bullying another!
The Eagle intervened.."Around me gather"
Play together, from Nastiness Refrain..
My name is Ephraim!
Ephraim Varkey that is!

---
The roaches escaped their enclosure in space!
Frightened Astranots in every direction race!
The Eagle calmly caught them with an inverted Can..
My name is Chetan..
Chetan Kuntamalla, that is!

---
The Kid's soccer team was a mess!
"No Coach" they cried in distress..
The Eagle stepped in, they score to win!
My name is Alvin..
Alvin Kishore, that is!

---
"Oh! my god, I spent too much, my balance is erased!
Very tight budget, have to live on a shoelace!
"I will put you in my trust, Dad!" said the Eagle with grace!
His name is Sarvesh..
Sarvesh Tirumalai.. that is!
---

(I don't know if you liked the verse, but I am sure that the Tirumalai's are happy!)

So there you have it, gentle people! The magnificent seven. Out to make our world a better place. This dream is just the trailer of what is to come from this magnificent seven in the years ahead.  Troop 394 is fully confident that they are upto what the future holds. It will be a challenge of-course, and they are used to challenges. They showed that in their journey toward the Eagle! They are no shirkers for hard work, no backing down whether the challenge is physical, mental or psychological.

Magnificent seven..Your eagle achievement is Big and let it be the start and the push for something Bigger! Always remember you are an eagle, and whatever you choose to do, fly high!

Gentlepeople, we need them, especially at this time.. The world is topsy-turvy right now, and we are left with the stress of considering the principles we lived by so far, whether they are relevant or should be thrown by the wayside. In Troop 394 we believe and know that our Scout Oath "to obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times, and to keep oneself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight" is timeless!

The seven Scouts before you now, know this by instinct, and have demonstrated how this oath applies, in their eagle projects, their leadership skills, and in their personal life. Troop 394 and I are proud and humbled today and thankful with reverence. Every great movie has an outstanding production team..Director, photographer, producer, Screenwriter.. Our team are the Parents,  the Scout Master, asst Scoutmaster, the Eagle committee. They all planned, orchestrated and hoped for this occasion and here it is! Let us not forget that this started in Cerritos, and thanks to the Mayor of Cerritos and many dignitaries. Thanks to the Concordia Church, the location where this plot was hatched! Now that the trailer is done, Troop 394 heaves a sigh, and then a loud "OK! Let us Celebrate!".
Let us do just that!

Cheers!
