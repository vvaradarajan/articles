# Cooking Efficiency
## Induction Stove
### Chana
Dry chana is soaked for a few hours (>2) and then pressure cooked to become soft and ready. The efficiency we are looking at is the pressure cooking part:  
In induction for a normal (2-4 persons) here is the process:
1200 W for 6 mins: The pressure builds up and the pressure cooker fizz-whistles to keep it in control  
300 W for 10 mins: The pressure is maintained to make the chana soft
Total power consumption = (1200 * 6 + 300 * 10)/60 = 170wh = 0.17Kwh. This currently costs (at 35cents/Kwh in california): 0.17*0.35 = 59.5 cents.
